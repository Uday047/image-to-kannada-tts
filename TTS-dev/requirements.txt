Yes, both text extraction (image processing) and text-to-speech (TTS) conversion are fully AI-based because they involve machine learning models trained on large datasets to perform their tasks intelligently.

1️⃣ Text Extraction (Image Processing) - AI-Based ✅
Library Used: EasyOCR

How It Works:

Uses deep learning models (e.g., CRNN - Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks).

Recognizes text from images without rule-based pattern matching.

Supports Kannada and many other languages.

2️⃣ Text-to-Speech (TTS) Conversion - AI-Based ✅
Library Used: gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)

How It Works:

Uses neural network-based AI models to synthesize speech.

Converts text into natural-sounding Kannada speech.

Unlike simple rule-based TTS, it learns pronunciation from vast speech datasets.

Thus, both text extraction and TTS conversion in your project are fully AI-based ✅.


Here are the AI models used in text extraction (OCR) and text-to-speech (TTS) conversion in your project:

1️⃣ Text Extraction (OCR) - AI-Based ✅
Library Used: EasyOCR

AI Models Used:

Detection Model: CRAFT (Character Region Awareness for Text Detection)

Recognition Model: CRNN (Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network)

How It Works:

CRAFT detects text regions in the image.

CRNN recognizes characters from those regions using deep learning.

2️⃣ Text-to-Speech (TTS) - AI-Based ✅
Library Used: gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)

AI Models Used:

Tacotron 2 (Text-to-Mel Spectrogram Conversion)

WaveNet (Neural Vocoder for Speech Synthesis)

How It Works:

Tacotron 2 converts input text into a mel spectrogram (speech representation).

WaveNet generates natural-sounding speech from the spectrogram.

Both components use deep learning models trained on large datasets, making them fully AI-based ✅.





 Indic Transliteration (indic-transliteration) is not AI-based ❌ because:

It relies on predefined mappings between different Indic scripts.

It does not use deep learning or AI models to learn patterns.

It follows rule-based transliteration, meaning it applies fixed conversion rules instead of learning from data.

Thus, it's not an AI-based tool but rather a rule-based system ✅.
